# phoenix_in_plover_extras

WIP

## fix.json

A dictionary designed to be used together with the Phoenix dictionary. This dictionary should fix everything that doesn't work in the Phoenix dictionary.

Two plugins are required:

- number-format: https://github.com/Volensia/plover_number_format (you can't install this from Plover's plugin manager yet, I'm still waiting on the pull request)

- retro-text-transform: https://github.com/nimble0/plover_retro_text_transform

Additionally, one plugin is highly recommended:

- phoenix_stenotype: https://github.com/Volensia/plover_phoenix_stenotype

Credit to @winston on Discord for compiling `pipPunctuation.json` and `pipCommands.json`. This dictionary includes all the entries from those two dictionaries, and also a bunch of other stuff.
